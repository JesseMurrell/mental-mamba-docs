        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Mental Mamba. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our 
            mobile application and website.
        </p>
        <p>

            is linked to your identity to provide personalized features like leaderboards and progress tracking. 
            Anonymous usage is also supported with limited functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Information Linked to Your Identity (When Signed In):</h3>

            <li><strong>Diagnostic Data:</strong> Crash reports, error logs, and performance data collected during

        <p>

            and is not linked to your identity. However, you will not have access to leaderboards, account sync, 
            or cross-device progress tracking.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verify your identity using email-based login with one-time passcodes 
                (no passwords stored)</li>
            <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Create and manage your user profile, sync progress across devices</li>
            <li><strong>Game Features:</strong> Enable leaderboards, track achievements, save high scores, and display 
                personalized statistics</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Understand how users interact with the app, track feature usage, and measure 
                game performance</li>
            <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Analyze gameplay patterns to enhance game balance, difficulty levels, and 
                user experience</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Respond to feedback, troubleshoot issues, and provide customer assistance</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Send important updates, notifications about your account, and respond to 
                your inquiries</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Authentication Method</h3>
        <p>
            Mental Mamba uses a passwordless authentication system. When you sign up or log in, we send a one-time 
            verification code to your email address. Your authentication is managed by AWS Cognito, a secure cloud-based 
            identity service. We do not store passwords.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Data Processors</h2>
        
        <h3>AWS Cognito (Authentication)</h3>
        <p>
            We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito to manage user authentication and identity. When you create 
            an account, your email address and authentication tokens are processed by AWS Cognito. AWS acts as a 
            data processor and handles this information in accordance with their privacy policy and security standards.
        </p>
        
        <h3>AWS (Backend Services)</h3>
        <p>
            Our backend infrastructure is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). User data, including account information, 
            game statistics, and analytics, is stored and processed on AWS servers located in the EU (Ireland region). 
            AWS provides enterprise-grade security and compliance certifications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
        <p>
            Mental Mamba displays advertisements using Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use information 
            about your device and app usage to show personalized ads. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>App usage data</li>
            <li>Ad interaction data</li>
            <li>Location information (if permitted)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's advertising settings 
            (iOS: Settings → Privacy → Advertising → Limit Ad Tracking).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Apple Game Center (iOS Only)</h3>
        <p>
            On iOS devices, Mental Mamba integrates with Apple Game Center to provide additional leaderboards and 
            achievements. If you choose to use Game Center, your game data may be shared with Apple according to 
            Apple's Game Center privacy policy. Game Center integration is optional.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With AWS for hosting, authentication, and backend services; 
                with Google AdMob for advertising; with Apple for Game Center features (iOS only)</li>
            <li><strong>Public Leaderboards:</strong> Your username and game scores are publicly visible on leaderboards 
                (email addresses are never displayed publicly)</li>

            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations, court orders, or regulatory requirements</li>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information 
            against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)</li>

            <li>AWS enterprise-grade infrastructure security</li>
            <li>Regular security audits and monitoring</li>
            <li>Access controls and data minimization practices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
