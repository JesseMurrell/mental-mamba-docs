        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>10. Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            The App may display advertisements provided by third parties, including Google AdMob.

        </p>
        <p>
            You may adjust your device's advertising preferences to limit personalized ads. However, you will

        <h2>18. Severability</h2>
